        <h2><span class="icon">‚úÖ</span>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By downloading or using the Application, you automatically agree to the following terms. It is strongly recommended that you read and understand these terms carefully before using the Application.</p>
        
        <div class="warning-box">
            <p><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Important:</strong> Unauthorized copying, modification of the Application, any part of the Application, or our trademarks is strictly prohibited. Any attempts to extract the source code of the Application, translate the Application into other languages, or make derivative versions are not permitted. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to the Application remain the property of the Developer.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2><span class="icon">üîß</span>Service Modifications</h2>
        <p>The Developer is committed to ensuring that the Application is as beneficial and efficient as possible. As such, they reserve the right to make changes to the Application or to charge for their services, at any time and for any reason. The Developer assures you that any charges for the Application or its services will be clearly communicated to you.</p>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>‚ÑπÔ∏è Currently:</strong> Smart Shopping is 100% free and there are no charging plans at the moment.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2><span class="icon">üíæ</span>Data and Security</h2>
        <p>The Application stores and processes personal data that you have provided to the Developer in order to provide the Service. It is your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the Application secure.</p>
        
        <div class="warning-box">
            <p><strong>üîí Device Security:</strong> The Developer strongly advises against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which involves the removal of software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. Such actions could expose your phone to malware, viruses, malicious programs, compromise the security features of your phone and could cause the Application to not work properly or at all.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2><span class="icon">üåê</span>Third-party Services</h2>
        <p>Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions. Below are the links to the Terms and Conditions of the third-party service providers used by the Application:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Browser services (for PWA functionality)</li>
            <li>Device operating system</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2><span class="icon">üì±</span>Connectivity and Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>You should be aware that the Developer does not take responsibility for certain things. Some functions of the Application can work offline, but certain functionalities may require an active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider. The Developer cannot take responsibility for the Application not working at full functionality if you don't have access to Wi-Fi, or if you have run out of your data allowance.</p>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>üì∂ Mobile Data:</strong> If you're using the Application outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the Application, or other third-party charges. In using the Application, you're accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the Application outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">‚ö°</span>Limitations of Liability</h2>

        <p>With respect to the Developer's responsibility for your use of the Application, when you're using the Application, it's important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, since all data is stored locally on your device, the accuracy and integrity of the data are your responsibility. The Developer does not accept liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the Application.</p>
        
        <h2><span class="icon">üîÑ</span>Updates and Continuity</h2>
        <p>The Developer may wish to update the Application at some point.

        <div class="warning-box">
            <p><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Updates:</strong> The Developer does not promise that it will always update the Application so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the version of the operating system that you have installed on your device.
